# PHPRetro
A new iteration of the extendable virtual hotel site and management from Yifan Lu based off HoloCMS. This is a public rewrite of the initial project using the Laravel Framework

## Supported emulators
* Arcturus
* Holograph Emulator (Legacy)

## Planned features
Depending on which emulator you are planning to use the feature set of PHPRetro will change to accommodate the client revision the emulator is depending on, which means that some of the legacy features will not be available if you install PHPRetro for an Arcturus installation (i.e. In-site wardrobe, Habbo Club purchase...)
